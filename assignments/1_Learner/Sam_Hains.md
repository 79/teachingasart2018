# Learning

## Initial learning phase

The first thing that I do at the beginning of a learning journey, is conduct intensive initial research. In this phase I chaotically  consume all information available to me. Whether the subject is Post-Structuralist philosophy, a video game or something spiritual: I consult internet forums, social information platforms, knowledgeable friends and acquaintances. I tend to take advantage of different forms of educational media including text, video, conversation and audio depending on what my daily commitments are. For example,  transit becomes an opportunity for podcasts and audiobooks. This is where I will gain a sense of the general approaches and understandings of the subject of my learning.  

Starting my learning journey with this process allows me to quickly 'get up to speed', however the uncritical nature of consuming the consensus on a subject can be problematic. By learning the existing thought patterns on a subject, I can inadvertently internalise the prejudices of a system;  a limit for my imagination later on.

This part of the journey is characterised by excitement and enthusiasm. I am energized by new people, concepts and the fast initial progress of a new idea world. I tend to become ambitious at this point about what this learning will bring for me and I imagine myself as someone skilled or knowledgeable in the future.

## Mortality phase
My rate of learning begins to slow, and I am beginning to have thoughts about learning something different, or returning to something I already know. I am reminded by how difficult it is to achieve fluency in a new subject without sustained commitment. I begin to doubt whether further information or mastery will have a greater relevance to my 'practice'.

The slower pace of learning can result in distractions. I might become increasingly drawn into the allure of some future 'reward' or the glamour of being knowledgeable.

Why was I drawn to this subject in the first place?  Was I seeking external or internal gratification? To maintain my ambition I need to examine my motivations and develop a justification for continuing the process. I am at risk of moving onto another subject.

I am less confident about my ability to become skilled or knowledgeable in the future.

## Finding a rhythm and the maturity phase

Once I have found the justification for continuing with this process, I am able to move to the beginnings of a more mature learning relationship. This phase is typically announced to me through the lack or need for an interactive learning community.  

To create this sustainable learning relationship, I introduce structure and social incentive via learning communities. Shared learning experience has the ability to reinvigorate the learning process in a more sustainable fashion than before.

It is in this collaborative, community driven mode of learning that I find my most sustainable and meaningful long-term projects.
