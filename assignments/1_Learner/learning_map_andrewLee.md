# learning as a hierarchy of compressions

![map](./img/learningMap_andrewLee.svg)

## Compression

no absolute requirements. can pass whenever I'm ready

## Testing quality of compression

is it hard or solid?
is it brittle?
is it flexible?

## Hierarchy

each succession depends on the previous clases as a seed

## Failure

sometimes low level classes work fine, but high level class performance makes me doubt.

## Conditions for success or failure

## Refactoring

## Unraveling
